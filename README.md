# Malaria Prevention Drug Trial Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from a randomized clinical trial conducted in Mozambique to evaluate the efficacy of a new antimalarial drug for travelers. The study focused on adult visitors planning to stay for at least two months in a high malaria transmission region. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the study drug or a placebo, with the trial following a blinded design to ensure unbiased results.

## Data Description
The dataset combines information from two collection points:

### Enrollment Data
- Participant demographics (age, sex, birth date)
- Physical measurements (weight, height, BMI)
- Malaria transmission risk at origin (categorized as no, low, moderate, or high)
- Treatment assignment (active drug or placebo)

### Follow-up Data (2-month period)
- Malaria episode counts
- Bed net usage patterns
- Final visit date

### Derived Variables
The analysis includes calculated variables such as:
- Age in years
- Height in meters
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Binary malaria occurrence indicator

The study specifically targeted adults (â‰¥18 years) who tested negative for malaria at enrollment and were not pregnant. This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for analyzing the effectiveness of the new antimalarial drug while considering various demographic and behavioral factors that might influence malaria prevention.
