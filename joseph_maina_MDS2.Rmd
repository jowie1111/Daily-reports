## Instructions 

Solve the exercises below by providing the R code inside the code chunks, and the plain English answers outside (and below) the code chunks. Submit both the RMarkdown (.Rmd) file and the resulting HTML file. Data are provided in the `data` sub-folder.

## Data

A randomized clinical trial was conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug on the prevention of malaria for people travelling (visiting) to regions with high malaria transmission. The study took place in a remote village in Mozambique, in which adult visitors planning to stay for at least two months were asked to participate in the trial. The participants were enrolled within 24 hours of arrival, and randomly assigned to the receive the study drug or placebo (fake drug). 

The inclusion (eligibility) criteria:

- Having 18 or more years of age
- Not having malaria infection (confirmed by negative PCR test)
- No being pregnant

The trial was blinded, i.e., participant did not know if they were taking the active drug or placebo. The trial was blinded, i.e., participant did not know if they were taking the active drug or placebo. Data were collect at two time points, at enrolment and at end of follow-up period of 2 months.


The data collected at enrolment are provided in the file `recruitment_data.csv` and contains the following variables:

- `subject_id`: the unique participant identifier assigned at enrolment
- `date_enrol`: the date of participant enrolment, format: YYYY-MM-DD
- `date_birth`: participant's birth date, format: YYYY-MM-DD
- `sex`: participant's sex, coded 1 (Female) and 2 (Male)
- `weight_kg`: participant's weight in kilograms
- `height_cm`: participate height in centimetres
- `malaria_origin`: malaria transmission at the place of participant's origin, coded 0 (no transmission), 1 (low transmission), 2 (moderate transmission), and 3 (high transmission)
- `treatment`: the treatment group assigned to the participant, coded 0 (placebo) and 1 (active drug)


The data collected at the end of follow-up is in the `end_data.csv`, with the following variables:

- `subject_id`: the unique participant identifier assigned at enrolment
- `date_end`: date of the end of follow-up visit, format: YYYY-MM-DD
- `malaria_epi`: total number of malaria episodes the participant had from the enrolment till end of follow-up
- `bednet`: use of bed net by the participant during the study period, coded 0 (never), 1(sometimes) and 2 (always)

The data files are located in the `data/orig` subfolder.

The two data files where pre-processed in R to create a single final dataset for analysis, and saved to the file `merged_data.rds` in the `data/proc` subfolder.` During the pre-processing, new variables were created, namely:

- `age_y`: age in years at enrolment
- `height_m`: height in metres at enrolment
- `bmi`: body mass index at enrolment
- `had_malaria`: whether a participant had malaria during the study follow-up period (Yes/No)

The body mass index (BMI)  is a measure of body fat based on height and weight, and is calculated as
$$\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{w}}{\text{h}^2}$$
where $w$ is weight in kilograms and $h$ is height in metres.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Import the final (merged) dataset into your R session, assigning to an R object named `mds`. Then print the structure of the `mds` data frame. 

Are the variables data types in line with their description above?

```{r}
mds=readRDS("C:/Users/User/Downloads/AssigmentWeek2/AssigmentWeek2/data/proc/merged_data.rds")
str(mds)
summary(mds)
```

all variables are correctly formatted and as expected every variable is there.



#### Exercise 2 Solution: 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# converting variable types


```






### Exercise 2

One thing that can affect or distort the comparison of the two treatment groups (placebo vs active drug) with regard to the outcome of interest (having malaria during the study follow-up period) is the imbalance of the participant characteristics between the two treatment groups. Construct a table containing summary statistics of participant characteristics by treatment group. The characteristics to consider are: sex, body mass index, malaria transmission at the place of origin, age, and use of bed net. Include also the p-values from the appropriate statistical tests to check whether there are significant differences (of participant characteristics) between the two groups. 

Checking your output table, are there significant differences? If yes, in what characteristics?

#### Exercise 2 Solution: 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(finalfit)
library(kableExtra)

# Define variables
v_indep <- c("sex", "bmi", "malaria_origin", "age_y", "bednet")  # Independent variables
v_dep <- "treatment"  # Treatment group (Placebo vs. Active)

# Create the summary table with p-values
mds |> 
  summary_factorlist(v_dep, v_indep, 
                     p = TRUE, 
                     p_cont_para = 't.test',  # Use t-test for continuous variables
                     p_cat = 'chisq',         # Use chi-square test for categorical variables
                     add_dependent_label = FALSE,
                     cont = "mean",           # Show mean for continuous variables
                     total_col = FALSE, 
                     add_col_totals = TRUE, 
                     add_row_totals = TRUE,
                     na_include = TRUE, 
                     na_to_p = FALSE,
                     na_to_prop = FALSE,
                     include_col_totals_percent = FALSE) -> treatment_comparison


# Display the table with formatting
treatment_comparison |> 
  kable(caption = "Comparison of Participant Characteristics by Treatment Group") |> 
  kable_styling() |> 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = c('striped', 'hover'))




```
There are no significant differences between the treatment groups for any of the participant characteristics (sex, bmi, malaria_origin, age_y, bednet).Since p-values are all greater than 0.05, this means the two groups (Placebo vs. Active Drug) are well-balanced in terms of participant characteristics, reducing potential confounding.


### Exercise 3

We are interested in comparing, visually, the distribution of the body mass index between the two treatment groups. Use a box plot to achieve this goal. 

What are your conclusions? 
Are there any outliers?


#### Exercise 3 Solution: 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Create the box plot
ggplot(mds, aes(x = treatment, y = bmi, fill = treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.color = "red", outlier.shape = 16, outlier.size = 3) + 
  labs(title = "Comparison of BMI Distribution by Treatment Group",
       x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Body Mass Index (BMI)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Placebo" = "lightblue", "Active" = "lightgreen")) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 20, size = 4, color = "black")  # Adds mean marker



```
```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)

# Create the box plot with a violin plot overlay
ggplot(mds, aes(x = treatment, y = bmi)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "lightseagreen") +  # Violin plot for distribution shape
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, 
               fill = "orange", 
               outlier.color = "red", 
               outlier.size = 2) +  # Box plot with outliers
  labs(x = "Treatment Group",
       y = "Body Mass Index (BMI)") +
  theme_pubr()  # Apply a publication-ready theme

```

based on the two plots: It seems that there are outliers in both groups.The red dots in both the violin plot and box plot indicate BMI values that are significantly higher or lower than the typical range.These outliers may include Higher BMI values (~40+) and Lower BMI values (~15-18).The presence of outliers suggests some individuals have BMI values significantly different from the majority, but their distribution is similar across both groups.However the plots suggest that both groups have a roughly symmetric distribution with a slight concentration around the median.Moreover,the medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) are nearly identical, suggesting that the treatment (Active) did not have a significant effect on BMI compared to the Placebo.


##handling the outliers

```{r}
# Calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR
Q1 <- quantile(mds$bmi, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(mds$bmi, 0.75)
IQR_value <- Q3 - Q1

# Define outlier thresholds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_value

# Identify outliers
outliers <- mds %>% filter(bmi < lower_bound | bmi > upper_bound)
print(outliers)  # View the outlier rows

```

Instead of removing the ouliers i replaced them with lower and upper bounds
```{r}
mds$bmi <- ifelse(mds$bmi < lower_bound, lower_bound, mds$bmi)
mds$bmi <- ifelse(mds$bmi > upper_bound, upper_bound, mds$bmi)

```

```{r}
summary(mds$bmi)

```
 
### Exercise 4

The main objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the new drug (active drug) in preventing malaria infection. That is, we hypothesize that the new drug reduces the probability of getting malaria infection, compared to placebo. Some participant characteristics might be malaria risk factors (i.e., associated with malaria). It is, therefore, important to check for this associations before performing the confirmatory analysis. 

Check for possible associations between the participant characteristics and the outcome (`had_malaria`). The characteristics to check are: `sex`, `bmi`, `age`, and `bednet`. Present in form of table, similar to that of the Exercise 2. Include also the p-values.

What insights are getting from your output?


#### Exercise 4 Solution: 

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(finalfit)
library(kableExtra)

# Define variables
v_indep <- c("sex", "bmi", "age_y", "bednet")  # Independent variables
v_dep <- "had_malaria"  # Dependent variable

# Create summary table with p-values
mds |> 
  summary_factorlist(v_dep, v_indep, 
                     p = TRUE, 
                     p_cont_para = 't.test',  # Use t-test for continuous variables
                     p_cat = 'chisq',         # Use chi-square test for categorical variables
                     add_dependent_label = FALSE,
                     cont = "mean",           # Show mean for continuous variables
                     total_col = FALSE, 
                     add_col_totals = TRUE, 
                     add_row_totals = TRUE,
                     na_include = TRUE, 
                     na_to_p = FALSE,
                     na_to_prop = FALSE,
                     include_col_totals_percent = FALSE) -> malaria_risk_factors

# Display the table with formatting
malaria_risk_factors |> 
  kable(caption = "Association Between Participant Characteristics and Malaria Outcome") |> 
  kable_styling() |> 
  kable_classic(lightable_options = c('striped', 'hover'))


```
based on the p_values the risk factors sex and age are not  significant since their p values are greater than the level of alpha =0.05.On the other hand,A higher Bmi is a factor to be considered .articipants who got malaria had a higher average BMI (27.1 vs. 26.4, p = 0.025).Also Bed Net Use is a Strong Protective Factor.In this case the Participants who never used a bed net had the highest malaria risk (39.8%).Those who always used bed nets had the lowest risk (29.4%).p = 0.001 suggests this is highly significant, reinforcing that bed nets help prevent malaria.


### Exercise 5

Suppose that, for answering the main research question, we are going to used multivariate logistic regression, having the variable `had_malaria` as the dependent variable and the `treatment` as one of the independent variables. Looking at your output of Exercise 4, what other independent variable would you include in the model?


#### Exercise 5 Solution: 
Based on the univariate analysis, the independent variables BMI and bednet usage should be included in the multivariate logistic regression model alongside the treatment variable, as they show significant associations with the outcome (had_malaria).

The final model would include:

1. Treatment (as one of the independent variables)

2. BMI

3. Bednet Usage

```{r}

# Fit the logistic regression model
model <- glm(had_malaria ~ treatment + bmi + bednet, data = mds, family = binomial)

# View the summary of the model
summary(model)

```
Based on the model the variables are statisticallly significant.this indicates that treatment,bmi and the use of bednet is relevant and should be considered for decision making with respect to malaria.
